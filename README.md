- Focus areas: attention mechanism, transform-based models, neural language modeling and neural machine translation, multimodal and mutitask learning, meta learning and curriculum learning, automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis.
- Also : computer vision, reinforcement learning, graph neural network, systemic generalization, federated learning, robustness in machine learning ...
- I use pytorch by default, and tensorflow if the project constraints require it.
- I'm interested in philosophy (I'm a stoic, in the sense of Marcus Aurelius) and physics (theoretical, especially quantum physics, gravitation theory and cosmology)
- I do body building, muay thai (Thailang boxing) and MMA (Mixed martial arts) âš¡.
- If you have an interesting book to recommend, don't hesitate.
